      <description>3 personas are involved:
Org Admin Platform Admin Apps Operator Here are the needs of each persona:
The Developer persona is not involved in this workshop for the reason that they should focus on the code of their apps. The Apps Operator persona is responsible to set up the Continuous Integration part to build and push the container images associated to any apps the Developers are building. With this workshop we are not covering this part, we are assuming that the container images are already built, the Apps Operator persona will take it from here in this workshop and will configure the Continuous Deployment part.</description>

      <description>Before you begin you need to make sure you have the prerequisites in place.
Minimum knowledge It&amp;rsquo;s recommended that you have a minimum knowledge about Istio, Anthos Service Mesh (ASM), Anthos Config Management (ACM), GitOps, etc. Here is a list of resources you could leverage to get some familiarities depending on where you are at with these concepts:
What Is Kubernetes? Managing Kubernetes with Config Sync Using Config Connector for Google Cloud resource management Automating infrastructure compliance with Policy Controller Istio in 5 minutes ASM Value over Istio Cloud Armor in a minute Memorystore in a minute Cloud Operations Suite in a minute Based on these introductions, here are higly recommended resources to watch before running this workshop:</description>
